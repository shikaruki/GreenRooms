## Motivation

 I saw Many person who wanna to try dress before purchase but don't wanna use trial room many more time.
 for this perpose this model is very helpful for them.
 
MICROSOFT among its various innovative products gave the world, the KINECT. Along with it they showed us some possible applications in which it could be used, and among it was the Virtual Dressing Room, which was based along a similar problem statement.
But the model was applicable only for showrooms which could afford and actually own the Kinect setup. We thought of designing a product which was along the same problem statement but without the technical and hardware barriers.
Our model is applicable for any user who has a basic RGB camera on his device. Thus it can be extended to online shopping users and smaller businesses who wouldn’t have opted for a costly Kinect.

## Use Instructions
Run the Pycharm or Jupyter NoteBook in file and go to localhost. Predict will show you the result with the selected shirt and pant no.
